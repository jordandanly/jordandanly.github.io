## About Me

* I have recently graduated Eastern Washington University with a Bachelors of Science in Marketing and a Minor in Design. I currently work in sales at Nordstrom but am looking forward to pursuing a career in digital merchandising in the fashion industry.
* jordandanly.github.io is a single-page-landing that I created to showcase my work and provide links to my social media accounts.
